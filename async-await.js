/**
 * async and await are syntax features introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that make working with asynchronous code in JavaScript
 * easier and more readable. They are built on top of Promises and provide a way to
 * write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code.
 * 
 * Async : keyword used before a () name to make it async. 
 * async () always returns a promise.
 * If the promise is not returned , then the () will automatically wrap the value in a promise 
 * & will return that promise.
 * Async & Await combo together is used to handle the promises. 
 * Why do we need async / await?
 *      - Before async/await, Promises were handled with .then() and .catch().
 *      - While .then() worked, it could lead to harder-to-read code for complex workflows.
 *      - async/await simplifies asynchronous code, makes it easier to write and debug, and allows for more intuitive error handling.
 * How the promises were handled before async await ?
 *  1. using .then() for chaining -> resulted in multiple callbacks / PROMISE HELLS 
    *  function fetchData() {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched!"), 1000);
            });
        }
        fetchData()
        .then((data) => {
            console.log(data); // Output: Data fetched!
            return "Processing data...";
        })
        .then((processedData) => {
            console.log(processedData); // Output: Processing data...
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        });
    2. Handling Multiple Promises: To run multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously, developers used Promise.all.
    However, error handling for deeply nested or sequential logic could become cumbersome.
    const promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
    const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Hello!"), 1000));
    const promise3 = fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts").then((res) =>
        res.json()
    );
    Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
        .then(([result1, result2, result3]) => {
            console.log(result1); // Output: 3
            console.log(result2); // Output: Hello!
            console.log(result3); // Output: Array of posts
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        }
    );
* How to write async functions / How to convert sync () to async() ? 
    -> Use "async" keyword only before the () name.
    -> Use "await" keyword in front of the promise that needs to be resolved.
    -> AWAIT : only to be used inside the async ().
 * Which one is better - Promises or async await? 
    - Async await is just syntactical sugar , BTS JS is running the native promises code 
    - JS has provided us a better syntax, we can use it to make our code better
    - It also saves us from callbacks / promise hells
    - Code is more readable & scalable with async await.

/**
 * FETCH : fetch API is given by the browsers to  make API calls & establish communication b/w a client
 * and a server. 
 * 1. It returns a PROMISE which resolves to the response object which represents the response from the server.
 * This promise can be handled by using .then / async await etc. 
 * 2. Support for GET, PUT, POST , DELETE , PATCH etc. 
 * 3. Configurations for Headers, body and more. 
 * The Response Object
    - The Response object provides several useful methods to handle the server's response:
    - response.text(): Reads the response and returns it as a plain text string.
    - response.json(): Parses the response body as JSON which is again a promise.
    - response.blob(): Reads the response and returns it as a binary large object (Blob).
    - response.ok: Boolean indicating whether the HTTP status code is in the range 200â€“299.
    - response.status: The HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200, 404).
 * Options Object
    - The fetch function allows for customizing the request via the options parameter. 
    - Common options include:
        - method: HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
        - headers: HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Type).
        - body: The data to send with POST or PUT requests.
        - mode: The mode of the request (e.g., cors, no-cors, same-origin).

/**
 * When this () gets executed, hello world! will be printed first. 
 * When JS engine sees the await, handlePromise() will be suspended from the call stack so that the main thread
 * doesn't get blocked for other operations. 
 * until the promise gets resolved, then it will come back again in the call stack 
 * & will resume from where it left off.
 * Then again it seees await, it will suspend again until the pr2 resolves, post that it'll come back to 
 * call stack again.
